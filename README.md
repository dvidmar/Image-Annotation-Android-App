# Image-Annotation-Android-App
A Kivy app to annotate either bounding boxes or painted boundaries over a folder of images.

To push the main app to your android device, follow the Kivy instructions here: https://github.com/kivy/kivy.  Your annotations are saved in a JSON file as you go, and resumed every time you open the app.  

To gather and plot your annotations in python, transfer the saved JSON file to your computer and follow the notebooks in the json folder.
